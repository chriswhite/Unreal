ComputeShader

Implements a basic compute shader using normal blueprints, render targets and materials.

This provides an easy way to develop and run compute shaders without any plugins or C++

The included example application locates the brightest pixel in a texture.

Developers can modify this example to perform any computation within a material, optionally using custom nodes for bespoke HLSL.

A unit test is also provided to verify proper functionality.
